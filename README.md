Hi,

This is a testing utility to test any REST based api or basically any web end point.

The main theme behind this project is to make the process of writing and maintaining  tests simpler than simplest.
Adding a test case is as simple as writing a small json object in a file. An average test case does not take more than 4 lines.

Any ideas to improve this project are welcome.

To understand how this works and how simple it is to use please read the [wiki](https://github.com/manuskc/API_Tester/wiki/How-to-use-API-Tester)

Let me know your thought and feed back when you use this.
